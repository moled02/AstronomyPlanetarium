MODULE OR FORM NOT FOUND ???  DON'T PANIC!


On my system, the path where the files are located is:

D:\PROGRAM FILES\DevStudio\VB\VSOP87VB\

This may have to be accounted for on your system for the files to be found and 
loaded and run properly.  Each planet's directory should contain all the files
required to run the included template base program.

If you get messages saying modules can't be found, then from the PROJECT MENU, 
select ADD MODULE and load the EXISTING module(s) from the same directory as the 
Planet.VBP file you're trying to load.  When you relocate the directory with the 
VB files, Visual BASIC still looks in the former location for any attached 
modules.  This will generate an error until the modules are reloaded and the
VB source code re-saved.  This is what will happen if your path to the VSOP87VB 
files is different than my original save path, which is very likely, but simple 
to correct as indicated.  You may also have to do the same with the VB project
form also.

Each planet template uses 3 modules.
For example, the Earth template has the modules:

Ephem101.bas
Earth_Header.bas
Earth_LBR.bas

For the rest of the planets, the same format holds.
